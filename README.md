# ðŸš€ Data Science Projects at CODSOFT ðŸš€

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing various data science projects I've worked on during my internship at CODSOFT. This repository includes projects on predictive modeling, data analysis, and machine learning, highlighting my hands-on experience with different datasets and techniques.

## Repository Structure

- **Titanic Survival Prediction (`titanic.ipynb`)**
- **Movie Rating Prediction (`movies_rating_prediction.ipynb`)**
- **Iris Classification (`iris.ipynb`)**
- **Sales Prediction (`sales_prediction.ipynb`)**
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection (`creditcard.ipynb`)**

## Project Descriptions

### Titanic Survival Prediction (`titanic.ipynb`)

Developed a predictive model to determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. This project leverages machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and decision trees.

### Movie Rating Prediction (`movies_rating_prediction.ipynb`)

Built a model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors. Used regression techniques to analyze historical movie data and estimate user or critic ratings.

### Iris Classification (`iris.ipynb`)

Implemented a classification model to categorize iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements. Applied various classification algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine.

### Sales Prediction (`sales_prediction.ipynb`)

Created a predictive model to forecast future sales based on historical sales data. This project involves time series analysis and regression techniques to predict sales trends.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection (`creditcard.ipynb`)

Developed a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of transactions. Utilized various anomaly detection and classification algorithms to identify potential frauds.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this repository up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
